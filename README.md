# Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience workshop (2023)

Tutorial notebooks and slides for the [FUN 2023](https://www.funfaculty.org/conference_2023_wwu) workshop "Integrating programming into neuroscience courses" *and* the Society for Neuroscience workshop "Teaching Neuroscience: New Approaches to Electrophysiology Labs."

### There are three different ways you can interact with these materials from your browser:

1. We will predominantly be working on Google Colab:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/ajuavinett/FUN_2023/)

2. But Binder is another option:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ajuavinett/FUN_2023.git/)

3. And a third option (necessary for working with NWB datasets) is cloning this repo in the [Dandihub](http://hub.dandiarchive.org).

### There are several ways to implement these notebooks in your class:
- Run notebooks via Binder or Colab, as demonstrated above
- Set up a [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation-guide-hard.html) for your course or university (e.g., the [UCSD DataHub](http://datahub.ucsd.edu))
- Ask students to download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Python, which includes Jupyter Notebook, many useful packages and more, to run these notebooks locally
